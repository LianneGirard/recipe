// Ingredients
1 cup vital wheat gluten
¼ cup nutritional yeast
1 tsp garlic powder
1 tsp onion powder
1 tsp smoked paprika
½ tsp salt
¾ cup vegetable broth
2 tbsp soy sauce
1 tbsp tomato paste

Instructions
In a large mixing bowl, combine the vital wheat gluten, nutritional yeast, garlic powder, onion powder, smoked paprika, and salt.
In a separate bowl, whisk together the vegetable broth, soy sauce, and tomato paste until well combined.
Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until a dough forms.
Knead the dough for a few minutes until it becomes elastic and smooth.
Shape the dough into a log or a ball, depending on what you plan to use it for.
In a large pot, bring 4 cups of low-sodium vegetable broth and 2 tablespoon of soy sauce to a boil. (NOTE: you could also use water in place of broth, but I prefer broth for the flavor.)
Reduce the heat to a simmer and add the seitan dough.
Cover the pot and let the seitan simmer for 45-60 minutes. The longer it cooks, the firmer it will become.
Once the seitan is cooked, remove it from the pot and let it cool.
Once the seitan has cooled, it can be sliced or diced and used in any recipe you desire.
